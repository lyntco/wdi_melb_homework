Happy Birthday
Write a program that asks what year a person was born in, then the month, then the day.

Figure out how old they are and give them a cake for each birthday they have had.



puts "What month were you born in? "
year = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "What year were you born in? "
month = gets.chomp.to_i

puts "What date were you born on? "
day = gets.chomp.to_i







  # age = Date.today.year - birthday.year
  #   age -= 1 if Date.today < birthday + age.years #for days before birthday


  #   Date.today.month < birthday.month or Date.today.month == birthday.month && Date.today.mday < birthday.mday
