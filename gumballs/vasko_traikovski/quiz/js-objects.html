<h1>Exercises: Objects</h1>
<h2>
The Recipe Card
</h2>
<p>
<h4>Never forget another recipe!
</h4>

</p><p>
Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).
</p><p>
On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:
</p><p>
<ul>
  <li>Mole</li>
  <li>Serves: 2</li>
  <li>Ingredients:</li>
  <li>cinnamon</li>
  <li>cumin</li>
  <li>cocoa</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Reading List</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!</h4>
</p><p>
Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
</p><p>
Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien". Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
</p><p>
<h2>The Movie Database</h2>
</p><p>
<h4>It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!</h4>
</p><p>
Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
</p><p>
Create a function to print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
