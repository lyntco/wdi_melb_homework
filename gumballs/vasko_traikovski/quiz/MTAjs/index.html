<h1>Activity</h1>

<h3>Create a program that models a simple subway system.
</h3>
The program takes the line and stop that a user is getting on at and the line and stop that user is getting off at and prints the total number of stops for the trip.
<h3>There are 3 subway lines:</h3>
The N line has the following stops: Times Square, 34th, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and 8th
</p><p>
The L line has the following stops: 8th, 6th, Union Square, 3rd, and 1st
</p><p>
The 6 line has the following stops: Grand Central, 33rd, 28th, 23rd, Union Square, and Astor Place.</p><p>

All 3 subway lines intersect at Union Square, but there are no other intersection points. (For example, this means the 28th stop on the N line is different than the 28th street stop on the 6 line, so you'll have to differentiate this when you name your stops in the arrays.)</p><p>

<h3>Psduo Code</h3>

set n  to a list of stations</p><p>
set l  to a list of stations</p><p>
set 6  to a list of stations</p><p>

set lines to n, l, 6</p><p>

input start line</p><p>
input start station</p><p>
input stop line</p><p>
input stop station</p><p>

if start line == stop line</p><p>
  get index position of start station in start line</p><p>
  get index position of stop  stations in line</p><p>

  if start station index > stop station index</p><p>
    print range between those index in reverse</p><p>
  else</p><p>
    print range between those index</p><p>
